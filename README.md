9gagfeed

Here is the description:
1. Please use provided RSS feed to design a web service, purely display any of those 4 tabs from the rss feed.    http://9gag-rss.com/
2. Please do some basic caching on the backend, as there are some rate limit on the rss feed.
3. You don't need to write any db related work just calling from the rss should be good. 
4. You need to host it and provide us the url for the result and share us the github code.
5. (optional) Would be nice if you wrap everything up in Docker.
